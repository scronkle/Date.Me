# date.me

## a webapp for the chronically scatterbrained romantics



i am really bad at thinking of date ideas. the hardest part is always just remembering what human activities exist that can be done as a couple.

so i'm making a website to take the hard step for me

---

do *NOT* ask me how long i spent collecting these date ideas

do *NOT* ask me how long i spent building this

i do NOT wanna talk about it >:(

if u find bug or you can write my code better than me, dm me on twit @averagestboi
